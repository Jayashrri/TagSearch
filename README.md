# TagSearch

## Project Overview
A small application in which user can add tags to an article with a search feature. For this, there is an input field while adding or editing an article which can suggest already used tags and allow to add new if the tag is not available in the list. The newly added tags will automatically get listed in the available tags for new articles. Also, there is a search bar to filter out articles with the same tag.
